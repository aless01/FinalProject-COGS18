    "My code ChatBot asks you a variety of questions to which you will type in the input specified in the docstrings (text in red) at the top of each function and press Enter. After you type in this input you will receive a different output for each question asked. This code is extremely simple and easy to use. I hope you find the process of using this code to be simple. Thank you to Professor Ellis and all the TA's for all their hardwork and for helping me on my final project as well as previous assignments. This has been a true learning experience."
